# 🍏 H E L L O ! ! 
Hello everyone!
- WELCOME BACK! WOW!


__Our next group meeting will be Tuesday, Dec 14th @ 10AM EST (IN-PERSON)__. 

## Today's Goals ##
- Project playtesting
- Creating builds for other platforms
- Work session

## Project Playtesting
Find *at least* two other groups and take turns playtesting each others' game:
- Create a list of 3 questions for playtesters. These should be specific questions, not things like *"Is it funnnnn?"*
- Set up your game on one to two team member's laptops
- Write down instructions for your game if they are not included already

- Elect someone in your group to take notes on the feedback you get from each playtester
- Find me and make sure I give you feedback.

## Unity 12 Materials

### Creating builds for other platforms
To create a build for another platform you will first need to add a module to your Unity installation. [Here's a video](https://youtu.be/Dg6FV7g6uLw) of the process.

## Work Session
Work session until 3pm today. Spread out. You're welcome to work in the classroom or in the open lab outside of the classroom. 

__Make sure your group checks in with me to give a progress report before leaving today.__

## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

### Final Project (Due next week @ 10 AM!)


__Due next week__

Create both Mac and PC builds for your game. (*File > Build* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build*). __Test them__ and then upload to each team member's class Drive folder *before* the start of class. 

In the zip folder, include a README.txt file with...
-  the title and description of your game
- instructions for playing 
- and any known bugs

__Share links to the builds on our class Discord. I'll set up a channel)__
