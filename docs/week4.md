- Bonus: Using fonts with UI Text. A simple timer.

## Unity 3: Code
[Here is a demo project for today](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zuQXmXnT-LN5aAHimkH-eWIRHOnbek8_/view?usp=sharing)

Unity Week 3 notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EkqUYH_UmSQY7d172gm1MGxuho-rApRkAYrqFm07P5c/edit?usp=sharing)

## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

Please reach out this week if you have any significant issues you can't resolve. Also, the [Unity Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/) is a quite overwhelming at first, but it's a really great resource that you need to get familiar with to work with code in Unity.

## Goallllll
__Build on the Unity Demo from class__

Build a *new level* using the things we developed together in class today focused on getting the highest score. Rewriting the scripts from class will reinforce what you've learned and help you identify areas for improvement. Experiment with small changes to the code.

[Here are reference scripts we made in class today](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YSGZ1R9pKSO9NNgsuBKIjKCe_YTgH9KR/view?usp=sharing), just in case the ones you worked on in class are a bit of a mess!

*Your new level...*

Think about the player's goals and how you can complicate that (make it more fun) through the introduction of meaningful conflict (obstacles, score, & a time limit). *What is a good balance of these elements which make collecting items in your scene feel fun and not just a task? How can you introduce drama, a dilemma, or otherwise encourage a player to take a risk?*

*Make it your own...*

Choose a theme for your level, make some art assets, choose an appropriate font for your UI text, find good sound(s)

Work with the code examples from this week. You can ask me if you need some assistance adding some behavior, but if it's too far beyond what we're currently working with, I'm going to politely say "No". 

__Searching around online without knowing what you're doing is a massive time sink, so don't do that either.__ Working with what you've got is *the constraint*.

*Build it...*

Save your Scene often and when you're satisfied, build it! (*File > Build & Run* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build and Run*)

__Due next week__

Please upload a build of your game (Mac or PC) to your class Drive folder *before* the start of class. In the zip folder, inlcude a txt file with instructions for playing your game, including the goal.


## Game Design Research: Scores

Next week, Unity coding is going to take a bit of a backseat while we talk about arcade games and playing for score. We'll be looking at some things, playing some emulated games, and discussing how they work.

*Research...*

In preparation for this, I want you to research one game (arcade-style or other!) that you've played that you felt *successfully* encouraged you to play for score. Can be any game that meets this criteria for you.

__Due next week__

Post a link to the game (if posting a Youtube link, try to find a video without commentary) and a brief 2-3 sentence description of why you chose it to the #week-4 Discord channel.
