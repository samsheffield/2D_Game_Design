## Cameras!

## Final Project: It Takes Two

__Due: December 14th @ 10 AM EST__

### Description

You and your team will design a small 2D game which is played by two players simultaneously. You can approach the design of this prototype in any way that somehow encourages play between two people: 

*Is it cooperative? Competitive? Is it one player controlled by two people? A mysterious space explored with a friend? Is it hand holding? Do we take turns?*

__Important: This is  a local multiplayer game, not a networked multiplayer game.__

### Working together
Please avoid tools like Unity Teams & Github to manage your project on this one unless everyone in your team has had experience with this (we will cover some of these approaches in Advanced 2D Game Design).

Instead...
- Assign roles to team members (what are your primary contributions?) 
- Be sure to assign one person the role of putting together the project files that everyone contributes
- Use email & Google Drive to share project files so that all members have a copy
- Use UnityPackages to share Unity files between team members
- Format your visual assets before sharing (72 dpi files, properly scaled to fit your game)
- Create a shared Google Doc with each team member's weekly tasks
- Schedule a project check-in or group work session between class sessions (in-person or on Class or MICA Game Lab Discord)
- __Make sure you are all working with the *exact same* version of Unity for your team's game__


### Deliverable
Tested builds for Mac and PC. Linkjs will be posted on the class Discord.

### Schedule
- 11/30: Brainstorming and prototyping
- 12/07: Playtest first prototype. Work session
- 12/14: Project due for final playtesting

### Brainstorming


Here's the plan:
- Share your ideas with your group (All ideas are valid, but not each will be chosen (don‚Äôt take it personally)
- Rounds of quick responses until idea is narrowed down (30 minutes, then break, repeat)
- What is the scope?
- Do you have the skills you need? 
- What help do you still need?
- What are good game precedents?
- __Come up with a quick pitch (two to three sentences which descibes your idea using compelling language) to share with class__

## After Lunch

### Let's take a look at your recent work

Here's a good opportunity to show off work and get some feedback from the class.
- Anything from the past few weeks
- New volunteers are always appreciated/encouraged
- You pick who plays your game (_even me!_)

## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

### Final Project: First Prototoype (Due next week!)

__Your first prototype is due at the start of class next week.__


This is a *buggy but playable* version of your game. It should demonstrate your core game loop, and it is not expected to have completed visual or sound assets. Others will be playing your game so be sure to include a README.txt file with instructions and known bugs.


__*You do not need to Build It...*__

Have your prototype up and running on two of your team members' laptops for others to playtest in class.
