#### Demo Materials
- Download these modified Sokoban spritesheet assets from Kenney.nl ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-KaWeXpg04G2rbwtdpV0DYItFKjHnmdU/view?usp=sharing)). I've downsampled them to fit a 16 x 16 grid.
- Video of today's demo is available [here](https://youtu.be/FCeY796CrWw?si=qDgOcbDND8z15Zaq). 

# Homework

## Exercise 4: Exploration
This week you will complete the small game prototype that you started last week for homework. 

__Reminder: You are not permitted to use unlicensed artwork or music in your classwork. This includes others' IP (Intellectual Property). Please invent your own things!__

### Overview:
For this exercise, you will prototype a single level explorable by an animated player character. The level needs to have two things that we discover or interact with before we are allowed to leave/complete the level.

### For this week (Week 11):

Add animation for your player
- You should be able to control animation based on movement

Add interactivity with objects in your scene
- You will need to add some scripts to these objects

Create a Start and End to your game
- Choose something that feels appropriate to _onboarding_ and _offloading_ your players
- Make sure to include instructions on how to play


### You will turn this in next week:
Submit this assignment to Canvas by next week.Â In class, you will trade with a partner and do a little playtesting.
