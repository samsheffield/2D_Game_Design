## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

### Persistence Tests

Since I am out this week due to illness, this week's homework will also be very small and *technical*. This can be just an experiment in a few scenes, a small game, or a reworking of something you've already made. *Keep it interesting for yourself!*

- Create three scenes and pass a number from start to end using PlayerPrefs
- Play continuous background music in all 3 scenes using DontDestroyOnLoad
- Create one animation which triggers an Animation Event you create

*Build it...*

Save your Scene often and when you're satisfied, build it! (*File > Build & Run* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build and Run*)

__Due next week__

Please upload a __build__ (Mac or PC) to your class Drive folder *before* the start of class. In the zip folder, include a txt file with instructions for playing your game, including the goal. If collaborating, add to both team member's Drive folders.

## Next week

- Are you already planning not to be in class next week due to holiday obligations? __If you haven't already let me know, please do so no later than Sunday night__.
- __Also...__ please let me know if you can test out some of the senior GMD students' games on Monday morning. 
*Two of them are very short and won't require much time. One is a tabletop game that takes a little longer. Any time you can spare would be greatly appreciated! Please let me know!*
