# 🍏 H E L L O ! ! 
Hello everyone!
- It's been ages...
- Visual hierarchy in games
- Unity: Tilemap editor Intro
- Begin 1-on-1 meetings



__Our next group meeting will be Tuesday, Nov 2nd @ 9AM EST (IN-PERSON)__. 

## Today's Goals ##
- Discuss visual hierarchy in games
- Discuss spritesheets & tilemaps in 2D games
- Introduce Tilemap Editor

## Updated Project Materials ##
- I've spent some time adding to the script repository ([here](https://github.com/samsheffield/2D_Game_Design/tree/Fall_21/Standalone%20Scripts)). 
- I've also been adding to the demo video playlists and will add them to the front page of the website when I add this week's video.

If you have other specific requests/curiosities *please let me know!*

## Unity 7 Materials ##

Materials for this week:
- Create an empty Unity project today (we'll use placeholder sprites for our demo)
- [Download this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-gLBxvjM-gLC4QadyCc0sHyUjexSG82p/view?usp=sharing) spritesheet to work with this week (Thanks, Kenney.nl!)
- [How-to video for this week (tomorrow)]()
- [Notes for this week](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17K35oRbjn3Y7fw6Eb31wLEpZdqKUwRYs5TJtT9aqvg8/edit?usp=sharing)

## Visual Hierarchy ##

How do we make sense of what we are seeing? Hint: we have a lot of clues
- Molly Bang's *Picture This: How Pictures Work*
- [Some things](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xJSB7NVyR4g8ha75la-N3RCTjoom0vbH/view?usp=sharing) to consider

__Breakout Groups__

In small groups, find two examples of 2D games which you think successfully uses visual language to direct and communicate with the player. One example of:
- Some sort of "good" element (item, reward, etc.)
- Some sort "bad" element (conflict, hazard, etc.)
- Something which indicates a goal, destination, or a player's progression through the game.

Post your findings to this week's Discord channel, including a link (or links) to media, and then we will have each group report back to see what you've found.

## Midterm Meetings ##

I'll begin meeting with each of you today after lunch to give feedback on your progress. Please have your most recent class project loaded on your laptop.

These meetings will be 15 minutes long, but I'm happy to follow up with a longer meeting if you need more assistance. 

This week:
- Anne
- Georgia
- Ainsley
- Brandon
- Misha
- Maya
- Emma
- Jordan

## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

Please reach out this week if you have any significant issues you can't resolve. Also, the [Unity Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/) is a quite overwhelming at first, but it's a really great resource that you need to get familiar with to work with code in Unity.

## A Familiar Scene
__Spend some time with the Tilemap Editor__

Build a *small scene* based on some aspect(s) of your life that a player explore. Give the player a destination and things to encounter along the way. Add a player control script and experiment with small changes to the code.

__You can complete this homework individually or collaborate with one additional person from class__

*Your small scene...*

The small scene does not need to be a literal 1-to-1 realistic representation of your life. It can be symbolic, metaphorical, a kind of magical realism, a fictional account. It doesn't need to be super revealing or personal, just don't be too neutral in your choices *Hey designer, what exeperience are you designing??*

The scene can be small enough to fit in a single scene using a fixed camera position or the camera can follow the player by making it a child of your Player GameObject (as demonstrated in class) *What changes when a player has all the information about the scene in one view versus being introduced to them over time?*

Think about how you direct the player to different elements in your scene by taking advantage of patterns of visual hierarchy. Use shape and color to __give it a feeling__. *How do we know what our destination is? What are our clues to understand conflict, rewards, and goals in this space?*

*Make it your own...*

Choose a theme for your scene based on the details you choose as inspiration, make some art assets, choose an appropriate font for any text, find good sound(s).

Work with the code we've developed together so far in class. You can ask me if you need some assistance adding some behavior, but if it's too far beyond what we're currently working with, I'm going to politely say "No". 

__Searching around online without knowing what you're doing is a massive time sink, so don't do that either.__ Working with what you've got is *the constraint*.

*Build it...*

Save your Scene often and when you're satisfied, build it! (*File > Build & Run* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build and Run*)

__Due next week__

Please upload a __build__ of your game (Mac or PC) to your class Drive folder *before* the start of class. In the zip folder, include a txt file with instructions for playing your game, including the goal. If collaborating, add to both team member's Drive folders.


## In Two Weeks: Guest Speaker: Winnie Song (November 10th)
We're excited to have Winnie Song (BADBLOOD, former Square Enix) join us on Wednesday, Nov. 10th at 4:30pm to talk about [her work](https://wsong.me). She'll be giving the talk on twitch.tv/micagamelab. Please mark your calendars.
