# Week 8
Hello again! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Online builds (using WebGL)

## Important: Missing classwork
Pull up your projects from homework. Hannah and I will go around and check your progress and answer any relevant questions you might have. 

### Having issues?
_Having trouble with classwork? Need to review?_ Please set up some time to meet with me outside of class. I'm available most of the day on Wednesdays and I love to help.

## Uploading your work

For itch.io:
- Upload a zipped WebGL build.
- Set the Dimensions to 1280 x 720
- Add a description of your game
- Also upload a zipped desktop build (Mac or PC okay!).
- After testing, set the visibility to Public or Restricted (use SAM as the password).

For Canvas:
I need the URL to your zipped Unity project folder:
- Name the zip file _yourname_midtermproject_2d.zip_
- Include a file called readme.txt somewhere in the zip file which credits any assets you might use. You can create this using either Notepad on PC or TextEdit on Mac

I also need the URL to your itch.io page.
- Please don't forget!
