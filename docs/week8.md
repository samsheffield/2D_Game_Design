## Important: Missing classwork
Pull up your projects from homework. Hannah and I will go around and check your progress and answer any relevant questions you might have. 

### Having issues?
_Having trouble with classwork? Need to review?_ Please set up some time to meet with me outside of class. I'm available most of the day on Wednesdays and I love to help.
