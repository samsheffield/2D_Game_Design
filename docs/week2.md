# H E L L O ! !
Hi everyone!
- Looking forward to getting started with Unity today?
- I didn't receive any emails regarding issues, which (I hope) is good
- School seems to have forgotten [a holiday](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4762/jewish/What-Is-Rosh-Hashanah.htm) this week, so we're going to save a little intro to some of the earliest videogames until next week, just in case we have some absences.

__Our next group meeting will be Tuesday, September 14th @ 9AM EST (IN-PERSON)__. 

## Today's Goals ##
- Take a tour of the Unity Editor, to build on top of what you discovered this past week for homework.
- Start placing Gameobjects and moving stuff around in the Editor, bring in some assets to use as sprites and audio, and finally make a Build that can run on your .
- We're going to use some stuff I made for you which is partially set up and has a lot of code connected that you won't/aren't expected to understand. Have no fear, we'll start [running up that hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM) next week in class.
- We'll also be using some sprites (images used in 2D games) and an audio clip from [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl) in today's in-class work together.
- On top of that, we'll begin our semester-long (lifelong?) dialogue on prototyping and game design (from a very classical perspective).

## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

Please reach out this week if you have any significant issues you can't resolve. Also, the [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/Manual/index.html) is a little overwhelming at first, but it's a really great resource that you should get comfy referring to if something is unclear.

## Level One
__Rework the Unity Scene from class__

Build a new level using the GameObjects available in the Scene and Assets folder. 

[Here is the clean version of the Unity project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z6c1eN_m92KbIkcmnrQ-dYF9p4sO58KN/view?usp=sharing), just in case the one you worked with in class is a bit of a mess!

*Your level...*

Think about the player experience you want to create. *Is it difficult? Disorienting? Sweet?* What is the goal? Tweak the *Player's PlayerControl Component* setting to complicate the player's ability to accomplish the goal. 

*Make it your own...*

Choose a theme for your level, make some art assets (*these don't need to be pixel art either*), and use the Inspector to replace the sprites of the different Gameobject's *Sprite Renderer Component* with your own. Also, replace the audio clip on *Goal's Audio Source Component* with your own imported one (Kenney.nl is a good place for simple placeholder audio, as is Freesound.org).

__Do not add any code or mechanics.__ Work with what you've got.

*Build it...*

Save your Scene often and when you're satisfied, build it! (*File > Build & Run* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build and Run*)

__Due next week__

At the start of class next week I'll assign each of you a Google Drive folder for classwork. Please have a build prepared for the platform of your choice to upload then.
