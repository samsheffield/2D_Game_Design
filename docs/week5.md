# H E L L O ! !
Hello everyone!
__Our next group meeting will be Tuesday, October 5th @ 9AM EST (IN-PERSON)__. 

## Today's Goals ##
- Play homework builds
- Any Unity issues?
- Discuss early video games and scoring
- Unity UI System Intro

## Early videogames
Notes on early video games [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k1ymS66pLMykul5eZux3yb8JQUI3Zy1KxIH-MFJBL1I/edit?usp=sharing)
- Proto-games and experiments
- Arcades (pre-video games)
- First wave arcade games

## Playing for score
Score is a classic goal for games which is not specific to digital games (Sports!)

What are the examples you came up with? Meet in small groups to share and then elect one to present/discuss with the class.

Let's play some classic arcade games and discuss their scoring mechanics. Note: these are emulated online and not 100% accurate (for instance, sound doesn't work in all browsers)

The key controls for the emulator:
- 5 Insert coin
- 1 Player 1 start
- Arrow keys movement
- Ctrl (and sometimes Alt) Button 1*
- Tab system settings which can be used to remap general input keys (* Ctrl + arrow on Mac switches windows which will probably be very annoying. Press Esc when done)

Games
- Ms. Pac-Man (1981) ([link](https://archive.org/details/arcade_20pacgal))
- Centipede (1981) ([link](https://archive.org/details/arcade_multiped))
- Qix (1981) ([link](https://archive.org/details/arcade_qix))
- Tetris (1988) ([link](https://archive.org/details/arcade_atetris))

Extreme scoring:
- Modern arcade games like this
- Competitive gaming like this


## Unity UI Intro
Let's talk about working with the UI system! [Notes here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7JqRk2vrJCaNtsmW-f6qH6pX4_N9PYOng_CS5v5mus/edit?usp=sharing)

## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

Please reach out this week if you have any significant issues you can't resolve. Also, the [Unity Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/) is a quite overwhelming at first, but it's a really great resource that you need to get familiar with to work with code in Unity.

Unity's documentation on the UI system can also be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.ugui.html). Most important parts related to basics are:
- [Canvas Components](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/comp-CanvasComponents.html)
- [Basic Layout](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/UIBasicLayout.html)


## Additions/Editions
__Build on your homework from last week__
Revisit the game you made for homework this past week and make some additions.

*__Updated scoring!__*

Update the scoring system to allow a player to get an even higher score! Experiment with small changes to the code.

*__Attract screen!__*

Also, add a title scene for your game using UI text and imported graphics. Be sure to include an instruction to press space to start.

*__Refreshed UI elements!__*

Resize and reposition your game's scorekeeping (and timer) User Interface elements to be consistent with those on your title scene. *Also, check out [this large database](https://www.gameuidatabase.com) of game UI!*

[Here is a script to switch scenes](https://gist.github.com/samsheffield/bf5fc32420340b419e23822e3bb5399f), when you press the spacebar. *Be sure to add your title scene in the Build Settings and set it to the top of the list of scenes there*


*__Make it your own...__*
What's on your attract screen that *attracts* a player? Choose a compelling, appropriate, and readable font for your text, make some art assets, [pick good colors](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel). Want looping background audio code? Let me know!

*Build it...*

Save your Scene often and when you're satisfied, build it! (*File > Build & Run* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build and Run*)

__Due next week__

Please upload a build of your game (Mac or PC) to your class Drive folder *before* the start of class. In the zip folder, inlcude a txt file with instructions for playing your game, including the goal.
