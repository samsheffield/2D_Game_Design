## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

Please reach out this week if you have any significant issues you can't resolve. Also, the [Unity Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/) is a quite overwhelming at first, but it's a really great resource that you need to get familiar with to work with code in Unity.

## GENERATOR
__Build on the Unity Demo from class__

Build a *new level* using the things we developed together in class today, focusing on something being generated over time.

*Your new level...*

Think about how you can introduce at least one timed element to add variation to your level. This might be goal-related, or conflict, or something that happens in the background which helps establish the space where the game takes place and encourages them to continue playing. What kind of space is it? *Is it a peaceful space? A garden blooming? Is it a hectic space? A space where you can't touch things? A space where key things move?* Keep the player experience you want to create in mind when.

*Make it your own...*

Choose a theme for your level, make some art assets, choose an appropriate font for your UI text, find good sound(s)

Work with the code examples from this week. You can ask me if you need some assistance adding some behavior, but if it's too far beyond what we're currently working with, I'm going to politely say "No". 

I will add the reference scripts for class [here](), just in case the ones you worked on in class are a bit of a mess! Rewriting the scripts from class will reinforce what you've learned and help you identify areas for improvement. Experiment with small changes to the code.

__Reminder: Searching around online without knowing what you're doing is probably going to end up being very frustrating.__ Working with what you've got and reach out for help as soon as you can.

*Build it...*

Save your Scene often and when you're satisfied, build it! (*File > Build & Run* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build and Run*)

__Due next week__

Please upload a build of your game (Mac or PC) to your class Drive folder *before* the start of class. In the zip folder, inlcude a txt file with instructions for playing your game, including the goal.

## Lucas Wooleyhand Talk (Wednesday, 4pm on Zoom)
Lucas is a Product Manager at Big Huge Games and he will be visiting us online to talk about his experiences so far working in the game industry. It's open to all GMG students, so please attend if you can. Game Design majors/minor have already recieved an email with the link, but I'll post it in Discord for everyone as well.
