## Install Unity Hub on your computer(s)
If you have another computer at home that you want to use for classwork, go ahead and install it there this weekend. Or, if you didn't have your laptop this evening, be sure to install Unity before next class.
- Remember to install all of the software through Unity Hub.
- Be sure to choose Unity 2022 LTS.
- Be sure to install Visual Studio (or Visual Studio for Mac).
- If you are on Windows: add build support for Mac. If you are on Mac: add build support for Windows.

## Unity: First Steps
In preparation for class next week, please read the following sections of the Unity manual:
- [Starting Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/Manual/GettingStarted.html) (You can skip The Learn screen)
- [Unity's interface](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html)

## Check your Dev Tool/Programming editor/Visual Studio whatever
This will be a very important tool for us so I'd like you to test that it at least starts:
- Restart your computer if you haven't opened VS yet
- Create an empty Unity Project using the 2D Template (from Unity Hub)
- In the Unity Assets Pane:
-- Right click to create a new C# script (you can keep the default name)
-- Double click the file's icon and it should open in VS.
-- Please email me if it does not open, so we can sort it out by next week

# Coming Soon

## Global Game Jam!
Global Game Jam (GGJ) is coming up soon (Jan 26-28th). This is a great opportunity to warm up, finish a small game for your portfolio, work with new people/work with old friends/work by yourself, and have fun! **Don't worry if you've never made a game before, you have so many skills to contribute to a team.**

FYI: The GGJ consistently pops up in conversations with visiting game developers as something they view _very positively_ from prospective employees. It demonstrates your engagement with game development outside of school assignments, your ability to meet deadlines and work within constraints, and (possibly) your ability to work with others.
