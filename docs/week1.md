## Install Unity Hub on your laptop.
- Choose the Personal option (not Student)
- Choose Returning Users

## Install Unity and Dev Tools on your laptop
- Use Unity Hub to install Unity (version 2021.1.*)
- Add the Dev Tool Module (usually Visual Studio Something)
- Add the Build Support for your computer's platform (Windows or Mac)
- Uncheck Documentation if you don't need a local copy of Unity's documentation (I really only ever use the website)

## Unity: First Steps
In preparation for class next week, please read the following sections of the Unity manual:
- [Starting Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/Manual/GettingStarted.html) (You can skip The Learn screen)
- [Unity's interface](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html)

## Check your Dev Tool/Programming editor/Visual Studio whatever
This will be a very important tool for us so I'd like you to test that it at least starts:
- Restart your computer if you haven't opened VS yet
- Create an empty Unity Project using the 2D Template (from Unity Hub)
- In the Unity Assets Pane:
-- Right click to create a new C# script (you can keep the default name)
-- Double click the file's icon and it should open in VS.
-- Please email me if it does not open, so we can sort it out by next week
