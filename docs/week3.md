# H I ! !
Hello everyone!
- Build testsing
- Introduction to scripting/programming/coding for Unity

__Our next group meeting will be Tuesday, September 21st @ 9AM EST (IN-PERSON)__. 

## Today's Goals ##
- Upload build, test a peer's build
- First steps with game programming/coding/scripting using C#
- Getting player input and using it to create movement

## Uploading a build
- Let's review how to build you game for distribution!
- Create a file called README.txt and add the instructions, goal, and controls for your game
- Compress your build files and README into a single zip and give it a meaningful name.
- Upload this to your class Drive folder and share the link with someone in class who has the same type of computer as you (Mac or PC)
- Download, play, and work together to sort out any issues (let me know if you can't get a build working)

## Unity 2: Code
Download and unzip [these assets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KPHwHCRNY84B1hWzsGoNjjlktYSv6DWh/view?usp=sharing)
Create a new empty Unity project and add the Sprites and Sounds folder to it.
Unity Week 2 notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1paeJwxZZ3EHgO_Yc0L1f_xcDK6PAOSpJldFg-kxRGiM/edit?usp=sharing)


## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

Please reach out this week if you have any significant issues you can't resolve. Also, the [Unity Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/) is a quite overwhelming at first, but it's a really great resource that you need to get familiar with to work with code in Unity.

## Level Two
__Remix the game you made last week for homework__

Build a *new level* using the assets you used last week (plus any new ones you need). Write the scripts for player control, collision management, and quitting the application. Experiment with small changes to the code.

[Here are reference scripts we made in class today](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hgfQsnOc-VwRX8R439EeL7FC75gTo2HJ/view?usp=sharing), just in case the ones you worked on in class are a bit of a mess!

*Your new level...*

Think about the player experience you want to create. Is it different from the one you created last week? Do you imagine this one is played *after* the prior one? If so, what would a player already know about your game? 

*Make it your own...*

Use the theme from last week, and make additional art assets as needed (*these don't need to be pixel art either*).

Work with the code examples from this week. You can ask me if you need some assistance adding some behavior, but if it's too far beyond what we're currently working with, I'm going to politely say "No". __Searching around online without knowing what you're doing is a massive time sink, so don't do that either.__ Working with what you've got is *the constraint*.

*Build it...*

Save your Scene often and when you're satisfied, build it! (*File > Build & Run* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build and Run*)

__Due next week__

Please upload a build of your game (Mac or PC) to your class Drive folder *before* the start of class. In the zip folder, inlcude a txt file with instructions for playing your game, including the goal.
