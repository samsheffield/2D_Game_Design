# Homework

## Exercise 4: Exploration
This week you will be beginning a small game prototype that you'll work on over the next two weeks for homework. 

__Reminder: You are not permitted to use unlicensed artwork or music in your classwork. This includes others' IP (Intellectual Property). Please invent your own things!__

### Overview:
For this exercise, you will prototype a single level explorable by an animated player character. The level needs to have two things that we discover or interact with before we are allowed to leave/complete the level.

### For this week (Week 10):

1. Create three sketches of your level _on paper or using software other than Unity_. This will be your reference/key art where you establish the theme, look, and major actors of your prototype. 
    - What is in your world?
    - Who is your player?
    - What are we trying to do?
    - What kinds of things does the player interact with? 
    - Define the basic layout of your level.

2. Create a new Project file
    - Name the project Fourth_Game.
    - __Do not work on the Demo project we started in class tonight__. We will add more to it next week, so we want to keep it aside as a reference.

3. Create your tilemap(s)
    - Create your own tilemap sprite using whatever image making tool you'd like (note: this does not need to be pixel art, but it needs to adhere to a grid)
        - It does not need to be perfect of very complicated. Remember, you can always edit this image file later to make it better.
    - Make sure that you know the grid spacing that you are using so that you can set Pixels Per Unit in Import Settings properly.

4. Implement the tilemap in Unity
    - Import your sprites
    - Slice them up using the Sprite Editor
    - Create a Tilemap palette using the assets
    - Build your level using tilemaps in the Hierarchy
    - Remember: use different Tilemaps for things which need collision or not

5. Create one Rule Tile
    - Create at least one Rule Tile to use with your Tilemap

5. Add a moveable player prefab
    - Use a placeholder sprite for this week. Next week you can create an animated character.
    - Use the same kinds of scripts and components (Rigibdody2D, Collider2D) that we've been using so far.
    - Make sure the Sorting Layer Order is higher than your Tilemap Sprites. 
    - Tag this "Player".
    - Turn it into a prefab so it can be reused easily.

6. Add a camera that follows your player
    - Create a script that allows the camera to follow the player

6. Test it out
    - Try it out!
    - Can you move around and bump into things in an expected way?
    - Is everything visible?

### You will turn this in on April 2nd:
Do not submit this assignment to Canvas until April 2nd.Â Next week you will continue to develop the assignment for homework.

_Please bring your progress next week._

## Next Tuesday @ Noon: Jabari Weathers Talk
