## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

## Animator Experiments

__This week's homework is very *technical*.__ 

You don't need to make a game, just a scene to test out some different approaches to animation we explored in class today:
- A constantly looping animation
- A one shot animation that runs on an instantiated prfab or is triggered by code
- An animation that is started (and stopped, if you like) by interacting with a different gameobject
- A player movement animation controlled by code

*Build it...*

Save your Scene often and when you're satisfied, build it! (*File > Build & Run* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build and Run*)

__Due next week__

Please upload a __build__ of your game (Mac or PC) to your class Drive folder *before* the start of class. In the zip folder, include a txt file with instructions for playing your game, including the goal. If collaborating, add to both team member's Drive folders.
