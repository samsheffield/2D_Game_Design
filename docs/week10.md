## Homework ##

__Here's this week's homework__

## A (More or Less) Familiar Scene
__Expand upon the homework from this past week__

Experiment with adding more elements to interact with in your game using the techniques we covered in class today (SetActive, Triggering, World Space UI). *What do these interactions reveal to the player?*

Experiment with movement. *Does your player movement change? Are there things in your scene which move? Why?*

Do you need some additional functionality? *Let me know!*

*Build it...*

Save your Scene often and when you're satisfied, build it! (*File > Build & Run* or *File > Build Settings > make adjustments > Build and Run*)

__Due next week__

Please upload a __build__ of your game (Mac or PC) to your class Drive folder *before* the start of class. In the zip folder, include a txt file with instructions for playing your game, including the goal. If collaborating, add to both team member's Drive folders.
